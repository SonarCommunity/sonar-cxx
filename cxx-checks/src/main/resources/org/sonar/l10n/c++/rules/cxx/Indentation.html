<p>
Proper indentation is a simple and effective way to improve the code's readability.
Consistent indentation among the developers on a team also reduces the differences that are committed to source control systems, making code reviews easier.
By default this rule just check that each block of code is indented but not the size of this indent. The parameter "indentSize" allows to define this expected size
</p>

<p>The following code illustrates this rule with an indentation level of 2:</p>

<tt><pre>
class Foo {
  int a; // Compliant
 int b;   // Non-Compliant
}
</tt></pre>
