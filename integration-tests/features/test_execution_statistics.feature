Feature: Providing test execution numbers

  As a SonarQube user
  I want to import the test execution reports into SonarQube
  In order to have the text execution metrics in SonarQube and use such SonarQube features as:
  - continuous monitoring of those metrics
  - Quality Gates on top of those metrics
  - Overview over the test execution status
  - ...

  # |
  # | Specification:
  # | * The plugin is able to import test which conform to the schema described in xunit-schema.rnc
  # | * Additionaly, the plugin is able to import every XML format 'X' when given an XSLT-sheet,
  # |   which performs the X->JUnitReport conversion
  # | * To locate the test source file, there are several strategies:
  # |   1. The content of the property 'classname' is used to match to classnames in
  # |      the AST. This requires the test sources to be actually parsable.
  # |   2. If the testcase-tags have a property 'filename', its content is assumed to
  # |      contain a relative path to the according test source file.
  # |   ?? same for classname-content, actually??

  # This feature will contain (hopefully all of) following tests:
  # == Positive tests ==

  # Category 1:
  # Analysing complete projects with locating the test sources:
  # i.e a bunch of real-world & building projects holding tests,
  # the reports are generated by the test-runners and unchaged.
  # It is noted, how the reports were generated
  # (version, the parameters, operating system). Examples:
  # - googletest with unchanged reports
  # - googletest with filename-tag-augmented reports
  # - cppunit??
  # - boost??

  # Category 2: (later)
  # Simple mode tests. These one dont try to locate the test resources
  # and save the measures in context of them.  The testcases are
  # toolchain agnostic, the only thing that matters is the validity of
  # the passed XML.

  # Category 3: (maybe)
  # Micro-tests: *minimal* scenarios, which are testing only one feature at a time, e.g:
  # - locating a resource via the AST,
  # - locating a resource via the filename-tag
  # - transforming boost report
  # - transforming cppunit report
  # - ...

  # == Negative tests ==
  # Those also should be toolchain agnostic and test certain failure conditions. For example:
  # - Tests cannot be found
  # - Tests are invalid or empty
  # - the given XSLT is invalid
  # - the transformation cannot be done because of a faulty (cppunit?)-report

  Scenario: Importing unchanged test reports generated by googletest

  Scenario: Importing augmented test reports generated by googletest

      Test reports can be augmented with the filename-attribute which
      may help the plugin to assign the testcases in the report to the
      correct source code files.
