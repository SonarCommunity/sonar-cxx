Feature: Smoketest

  This is just for running a smoketest using a somewhat more complex testdata.
  Will be reworked later.

  Scenario: Smoketest
      GIVEN the project "smoketest_project"
      WHEN I run "sonar-scanner -X"
      THEN the analysis finishes successfully
          AND the analysis in server has completed
          AND the analysis log contains no error/warning messages except those matching:
              """
