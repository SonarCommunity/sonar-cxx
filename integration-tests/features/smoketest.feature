Feature: Smoketests

  This is for running smoketests using somewhat more complex test data.

  Scenario: Project using Bullseye coverage, xUnit, Cppcheck, Rats, Vera++
    This test verifies that analysis is able to import Bullseye coverage reports and import custom rules reports.
    Custom rules are created using Rest API, after test ends rules are deleted.
    Bullseye reports need to be created before running the test.
